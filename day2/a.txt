Day 2 â€” Part 1 Walkthrough

Problem Snapshot
- Input: each line is a report containing a sequence of integer levels.
- Goal: count reports where levels change steadily (always increasing or always decreasing) with step sizes between 1 and 3.

Approach
- Read each report line using fgets, tokenize on whitespace with strtok, and store levels into a fixed-size array.
- is_report_safe checks direction once from the first pair, then validates every adjacent difference shares that direction and magnitude within [1, 3].
- Increment a safe counter for each report satisfying the predicate.

Implementation Notes
- strtok handles consecutive spaces and trailing newline characters out of the box, simplifying parsing.
- The helper returns false immediately for reports shorter than two entries, aligning with puzzle rules.
- abs is used on the difference to avoid redundant branches when evaluating magnitude thresholds.

Why It Works
- Early direction detection eliminates redundant branching inside the loop.
- Reusing a preallocated buffer avoids heap churn and suits the fixed Advent of Code constraints.
- Rejecting zero-diff and large jumps directly mirrors the puzzle rules.

Complexity
- Time: O(T) where T is the total number of levels across all reports.
- Memory: O(1) auxiliary beyond the current report storage.

Validation
- Verified against sample inputs and the official Part 1 answer.
- Tested edge scenarios: minimal report length, maximum allowed step difference, and direction flips to ensure rejection.
- Manual regression: ascending sequences with mix of 1-, 2-, and 3-step jumps are accepted; any level plateau fails as intended.
